    "Alesh Compton's paintings are centered around the trace which can be defined as a mark, an object or other indication of the existence or passing of something. Traces that are left from interactions allude to moments but not necessarily a final product. These Gutai-inspired action paintings are accompanied by videos leaving room for the viewer to imagine the circumstances under which the artworks were born.",
    "This painting series was made in Paris at the DSXL artist residency and was shown in January of 2021 in an exhibition titled  'un Oueff Dur' .The videos were also screened separate to the paintings in Glasgow, June 2021 as part of the Alternative Degree show at SWG3.",
