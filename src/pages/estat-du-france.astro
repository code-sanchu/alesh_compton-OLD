    "Shot in December 2018 this documentary explores the gilets jaunes movement through interviews performed on the streets of Paris. The movement was named “gilets jaunes” (yellow vests) because protesters wear fluorescent yellow high-vis jackets. The movement, which  began as a fuel tax protest morphed into a wider anti-government protest. Alesh Compton goes to find out first hand what the people of Paris had to say about the movement.",
