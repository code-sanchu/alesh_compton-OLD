  description: [
    "Butterfly was a multi format project that took the form of a hardback book, film and touring exhibition, all of which were released in 2019. The project is a portrait of night life in Havana and the various characters that exist when darkness falls, centered around identical twins Shayra & Isabella, who transitioned from male to female together in the Cuban countryside, and now do sex work in the streets of Havana. The book was launched alongside solo shows in London, Milan (Spazzio Maiocchi) & Tokyo (komiyama books), where there was also a screening of a 22 minute film. The exhibition featured several large scale, mixed media collages and large format screenprints on unprimed linen. The book was available through IDEA books.",
