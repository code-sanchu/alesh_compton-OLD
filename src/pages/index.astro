  description: [
    "Squatumentary is a 124min documentary filmed during the pandemic at the DSXL, a squat on the outskirts of Paris.",
    "Navigating between the challenges of collective decision making and the personal relationships formed withing the squat, the video gives insight into the everyday living outside of conventional society. From collectively organized meals for refugees, to secret lockdown parties and international-scale dance battles, “Squatumentary” gives a multifaceted picture of what it is like to live in a repurposed space. The film reflects on the impact the squat had on its environment, as well as the artist’s personal experience of community lifestyle.",
    "As a place of constant change, DSXL at times housed as many as 32 residents and in other times, as few as 2. Editing down from over 70 hours of footage, the film is a document of how the community changes and develops through its time before they were expulsed and forced to find new living spaces.",
    "SQUATUMENTARY was premiered at a solo exhibition at the side gallery in Kyoto, Japan from 17/10/2022 - 30/10/2022 and went on to be screened at A.K.A Gallery and Datsuijo in Tokyo.",
