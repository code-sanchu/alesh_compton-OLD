ADD PAGE
--------
CREATE FILE
- Create new pages in the 'pages' folder.
- You can copy and paste another page.
- Rename the file.
  - the file name will also be the route name (what appears in the browser's url bar).
  - it's not a good idea to use spaces; use '-' instead.

ADD DATA
- Add data for the page.
  - change the title and description.
  - add image.
    - you need to add any images to the 'images' folder.
    - make sure you get the import path correct.
      - follow the format already there.
  - add youtube video.
    - simply add the url string copied from the browser url bar. The code will do the rest.
    - you can optionally add a cover image if you want.
      - you can also optonally add a position for the cover image.
        - either "top", "center" or "bottom".
    - IMPORTANT: if you add the same video twice on the same page it won't work.

ADD PAGE TO NAVIGATION
- Add the page to the navigation file (Navigation.astro in components folder)
- if the route (which is the file name) is the same as the page title:
  - e.g. "Butterfly".
  - simply add a string ("Butterfly") to the 'links' array. 
- if the route (which is the file name) is the not the same as the page title:
  - e.g. Diary Part 1.
  - add an object (surrounded by {}) with a label and route.
  - this is true for the home page which must have a route of "/".
- links in the array must be seperated by a comma.
- you can reorder the array however you want.

ADD FONT
--------
- add font to public/fonts
- copy the format in styles/global.css
